# Stylus — Project State

Last Updated: 2026-08-25

## Overall Status

AUTHENTICATION AND ORGANIZATIONS COMPLETE / READY FOR PHASE 2

The verified Supabase authentication and organization-isolation foundation is
in place. Company onboarding and later business functionality have not started.

---

## Current Phase

Phase 1 — Authentication and Organizations

Status: COMPLETE

---

## Current Objective

TASK-002 established secure multi-user authentication, organization membership,
server-side organization context and database row-level security.

TASK-003 is ready but has not started.

---

# Phase 0 Implementation

- npm workspace structure with `apps/web` and shared TypeScript config
- Next.js App Router application with strict TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS design tokens with light and dark theme variables
- shadcn/ui-compatible component conventions and aliases
- Lucide icon system
- responsive desktop sidebar and accessible mobile navigation drawer
- topbar with global search, notifications and account placeholders
- placeholder Home page with no business functionality
- Zod-backed environment validation and `.env.example`
- ESLint, Prettier and Vitest configuration
- focused navigation and Home placeholder tests

---

# Phase 0 Verification

Verified on 2026-08-25:

- `npm install`: passed; 0 audit vulnerabilities
- `npm run format:check`: passed
- `npm run lint`: passed with 0 warnings
- `npm run typecheck`: passed
- `npm run test`: passed; 3 files and 4 tests
- `npm run build`: passed; `/` prerendered as static content
- development server: started successfully; `/` returned HTTP 200

---

# Phase 1 Implementation

- browser-safe and server-only Supabase clients using `@supabase/ssr`
- Next.js Proxy session refresh using verified Supabase claims
- signup, email-confirmation, login and logout flows
- protected application and organization-setup routes
- server-side identity and organization-membership helpers
- organization setup boundary before entering the Stylus shell
- shell account identity, organization name, role and logout menu
- Zod validation for required public environment configuration and forms
- generic authentication errors that do not expose credentials or account state

---

# Phase 1 Database

Migration: `supabase/migrations/20260825000100_auth_organizations.sql`

Introduced:

- `public.organization_role`: `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, `VIEWER`
- `public.organizations`
- `public.memberships` with `(organization_id, user_id)` primary key
- private membership/role authorization functions with pinned search paths
- atomic `public.create_organization(text)` RPC
- restricted table/function grants
- RLS policies for organization reads, organization updates and membership reads
- pgTAP policy suite at `supabase/tests/database/organizations_rls.test.sql`

---

# Phase 1 Verification

Verified on 2026-08-25 with browser-safe test configuration:

- dependency installation: passed; 0 audit vulnerabilities
- `npm run format:check`: passed
- `npm run lint`: passed with 0 warnings
- `npm run typecheck`: passed
- `npm run test`: passed; 10 files and 27 tests
- `npm run build`: passed; 7 application routes plus Proxy compiled
- development server: passed
- `/login` and `/signup`: HTTP 200 with expected labeled forms
- `/` and `/organization/new` while unauthenticated: HTTP 307 to `/login`
- browser bundle scan: no service-role environment names or secret-key prefixes
- source scan: no credential/token logging or service-role client

---

# Manual Verification Still Required

The current machine does not have Docker, Supabase project credentials or an
available in-app browser surface. Before production deployment:

1. Run `npm run db:start`, `npm run db:reset`, `npm run db:lint` and
   `npm run test:db` in a Docker-enabled environment.
2. Apply the migration to a non-production Supabase project.
3. Configure the Site URL, allowed redirect URL and confirmation email template
   to use `/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email`.
4. Manually verify signup, confirmation, login, session refresh, organization
   creation, cross-user isolation and logout with real accounts.
5. Perform desktop and mobile visual QA in a browser.

# Product Direction

Stylus is a collaborative startup operating system.

Initial major capabilities:

- team accounts
- organizations
- tasks
- deadlines and reminders
- comments
- notifications
- activity
- whiteboards/moodboards
- company knowledge
- plugin infrastructure
- AI infrastructure

The first major business plugin will be Marketing.

Marketing initially focuses on pre-product Instagram Reel strategy and
creative intelligence.

---

# Completed Planning

The following decisions have been made:

- Stylus will use a modular architecture.
- Core collaboration features are separate from business plugins.
- Marketing is the first business plugin.
- Marketing initially focuses on Instagram Reels.
- Marketing uses multi-agent creative reasoning.
- Competitor Reel analysis is required.
- Reel analysis includes hooks, scripts, visuals, branding and pacing.
- Company and Marketing memory are isolated from Web Agency memory.
- Working content is not automatically permanent AI memory.
- Team task management is required.
- Task reminders are required.
- Completed tasks remain visible for approximately 14 days before being
  moved to an archive.
- Archived tasks are not automatically deleted.
- Collaborative whiteboards/moodboards are required.
- Whiteboards support images, text, sticky notes and comments.
- Stylus must use a professional SaaS UI.
- UI icons use Lucide rather than emojis.
- Initial hosting should avoid mandatory VPS costs.
- The production application must not depend on the developer laptop.
- The Windows laptop may act as an optional heavy AI/media worker.
- Codex sessions use repository documentation for continuity.

---

# Current Technology Direction

Frontend:
- Next.js
- TypeScript

UI:
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Lucide React

Authentication:
- Supabase Auth

Database:
- Supabase PostgreSQL

Realtime:
- Supabase Realtime where useful

Vector search:
- pgvector

File storage:
- Supabase Storage initially

Queue/cache:
- Upstash and/or persisted PostgreSQL job infrastructure depending on
  workload

Local AI:
- Ollama

Heavy worker:
- Python
- Windows-compatible

Media:
- FFmpeg
- OpenCV

Transcription:
- faster-whisper or equivalent local implementation

---

# Hosting Constraint

Initial production infrastructure should have no mandatory paid VPS.

The developer's laptop is NOT a production application server.

Stylus must remain available to teammates while the laptop is powered
off.

Heavy jobs may remain queued until an eligible worker becomes available.

---

# Current Work

TASK-002 complete. TASK-003 is ready for a future implementation session.

---

# Known Issues

No known implementation defects.

Real Supabase/pgTAP and interactive browser verification remain required as
described above because the necessary external environment was unavailable.

---

# Next Recommended Action

Execute TASK-003 from CODEX_TASKS.md on a dedicated task branch.

---

# Next Session Handoff

Read:

1. AGENTS.md
2. PROJECT_STATE.md
3. CODEX_TASKS.md
4. docs/ROADMAP.md
5. docs/DECISIONS.md

TASK-002 is complete and verified on `codex/task-002-auth`.

Begin TASK-003 only in a new session after reviewing the repository and current
worktree. Preserve unrelated user changes and do not begin TASK-004.
